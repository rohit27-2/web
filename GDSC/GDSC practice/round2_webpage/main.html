                <p><b> PetFo </b>    believes that the lovable innocence found in every dog helps us reconnect with our true selves and teaches us valuable life lessons. Simply put, dogs make us better people. And that has a profound impact on the world in which we live.

                    That's why it's so important to us to ensure we feed the good in every dog.</p>

            <h3 style="padding: 10px;">Nutritional Commitment</h3>
            <p><b>PetFo </b> dry and wet dog food and treats encourage, support, fortify and fuel a dog's power to be their healthiest and happiest selves at every stage of life — puppy, adult and senior.</p>
            <h3>Commitment to Shelter Dogs</h3>
            <p><b>PetFo®</b> believes all dogs make the world a better place — and all dogs deserve a loving forever home.

                The <b>PetFo® </b>Foundation supports shelter and rescue organizations across the country that work tirelessly to match shelter dogs with loving owners. If you'd like to help PetFo help shelter dogs, visit www.petfofoundation.org
                
                To help even more shelter dogs, <b>PetFo®</b> recently launched the You Buy We Give program. Every time you purchase <b>PetFo®</b> food, we donate healthy meals to shelter dogs in need.</p>
