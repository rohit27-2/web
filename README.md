### What is HTML?

_ HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages._

### What is CSS?

_ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive. The reason for using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page._
